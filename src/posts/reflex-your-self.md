Back in my freshman year, I was excited about coding—solving algorithms, learning new programming languages, and exploring how computers worked. But I didn't have a clear goal. I was simply following my passion, something I'd been curious about since childhood.  

At the same time, I often found myself comparing my abilities to others. Some of my classmates were exceptional at coding, presentations, math, and so much more. I wondered why they seemed so far ahead while I struggled to keep up.  

Everything changed when I took a Personal Development class. It wasn’t just about skills—it was about mindset. I learned the importance of setting goals, managing time, solving problems, and working as part of a team. But the lesson that impacted me the most came from my teacher, who said:  

> *Everyone is unique. Don’t compare yourself to others—compare yourself to who you were yesterday.*  

That shifted my perspective. Instead of seeing my classmates as competition, I started observing them and realized something: each person had their own strengths, and they had worked hard to develop them.  

Another turning point came from my math teacher, who once told our class:  

> *They are not smarter than you; they just spend more time on it than you do. The more time you spend, the more you gain.*  

Hearing that changed the way I looked at learning. It wasn’t about talent—it was about effort. I stopped worrying about how good others were and focused on improving myself, one step at a time.  

A year later, during Engineering Day, a junior student approached me. He hesitated for a moment before asking,  

*"Bong, how do you get good at coding? Can you give me some tips? How many hours should I spend learning?"*  

I smiled, remembering the advice that had helped me. I told him exactly what my math teacher had told me and added,  

*"If you want to be good at coding, commit to continuous learning—never stop improving."*  

That conversation reminded me how much I had grown. I no longer saw learning as a race against others but as a lifelong journey of self-improvement.  

So if you ever feel like you’re falling behind, remember this: progress isn’t measured by how you compare to others—it’s measured by how far you’ve come. Keep going, and with time, you'll see just how much you can achieve.
