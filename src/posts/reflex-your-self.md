Back in my freshman year, I was excited about coding algorithms and learning new programming languages. However, I didn't have a clear goal—I was just following my passion since childhood. I was always curious about how computers work and how to make them function.  

But during my freshman year, I struggled with comparing myself to others. I wondered why some people were so good at coding, presentations, math, and more.  

### 1. A Lesson in Self-Improvement  

In my first semester, I attended a Personal Development class that helped improve students' mindsets. I learned how to set goals, manage time, solve problems, communicate effectively, be a good leader, team member, and student. One thing my teacher said really stuck with me:  

> *"Everyone is unique. Don’t compare yourself to others—compare yourself to who you were yesterday."*  

That changed my perspective. I started observing my classmates and realized how true those words were—each person has their own unique talents and strengths.  

### 2. The Most Valuable Advice  

One of the most motivating things I heard was from my math teacher. He said:  

> *"They are not smarter than you; they just spend more time on it than you do. The more time you spend, the more you gain."*  

That statement helped me stop comparing myself to others because I realized that I could improve if I simply dedicated more time to learning.  

### 3. Sharing the Wisdom  

During Engineering Day, an event where students showcase their projects, a junior student approached me and asked,  

*"Bong, how do you get good at coding? Can you give me some tips? How many hours should I spend learning to code?"*  

I simply answered with the same words my math teacher once told me. I also advised him, *"If you want to be good at coding, commit to continuous learning—never stop improving."*  

### 4. Final Thoughts  

I hope this advice helps you stop comparing yourself to others and start focusing on becoming a better version of yourself every day.
